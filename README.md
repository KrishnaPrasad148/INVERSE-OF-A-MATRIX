# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
Using the np.linalg.matrix_inv(), we can find the rank of the given matrix. 

## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.

#Developed by: S.Krishna Prasad
#RegisterNumber: 212223230108
```
```
import numpy as np
a = np.array([[6,2,3],[3,1,1],[10,3,4]])
b = np.linalg.inv(a)
print(b)
```
## Output:
